Virtual Waste Transfer Station

The Virtual Waste Transfer Station is a not for profit organization that is creating a repository of businesses and their waste stream information. We are generating a database schema and APIs that will allow businesses to easily add the types of waste, the amounts and the frequency with which it is created. Subscribers to the service will be able to query the system for the types of waste available, where that waste is being generated, and they can contact the waste producers via the platform.

We aim to empower businesses and recycling firms to achieve zero waste to landfill through a seamless data platform that connects valuable materials with responsible solutions. We plan on accelerating the circular economy by unlocking the hidden potential of commercial waste through an accessible and data-driven platform.
